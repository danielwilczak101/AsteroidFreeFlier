# EasyControls Overview:
Originally part of the NASA Asteroid flyer program has been repurposed by the EPPL to allow anyone interested in controls to go online and connect with a real working device and test their own control algorithms on a live device that is connected to the global internet. The spacecraft has been refitted with new and improved wiring, updated computers and a website that allows for members to connect and upload code to.

### [EasyControls.org](http://easycontrols.org)
The website is used to allow users to upload their controls code and see how the spacecraft responds.

#### 3. pi_imu  
Currently the imu doesnt use gravity vector to correct for drift. We also still need to validate all the readings.
