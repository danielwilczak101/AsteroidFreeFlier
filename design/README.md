## To do list:
This to do list will later be flushed out when I have more details to write about.  

1. Rail system with:  
    a. 12v Battery inclosure for main pack to run relays.  
        - Find out how much watts is needed to fire the relay. This battery may not be needed for running the craft.
    b. Pi Holder with lower portable battery pack (5v/12v).

2. Spacecraft mounting system.
    a. I was thinking this could be two 80/20 aluminum boxes that would have the height of the rotating platform. These boxes would also allow transporting the craftt to be alot easier since they can be disconnected.

    b. We having to test the rotating pieces because I believe the carbon fiber is cracked.

3. Connect the spacecraft top and bottom:
Long bolts need to going through the carbon fiber tubes. I was picking it up and I believe they will come apart which could happen while its running. This would be bad.
