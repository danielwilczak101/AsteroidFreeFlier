## Test Requirements:
Trigger the PI to run a python file that was upload via the web.
    - The file can just say print hello.  
    
## Solutions:
```Make the pi a webserver and allow people to connect to it. Then when people upload
a file it put it in a directory and anther python script would be triggered by it.  

Potential problems is to get outside internet for this we would have to use a phone or some other internet then the schools. 
```
    

```
This can also be accomplished if we just allow ssh from the web. But the school doesnt allow this.
```

## File Requirements:  
1.Website code.  
2. Raspberry Pi trigger event.
