## Test Requirements:
Assemble pressurize valve to operationg pressure and see how many Newtons of force it produces over time.   
    - Ask NASA man for tank pressure used on the craft.  

### Thrust values:
Thrust from test stand nozzle with following psi going to the solinoid.
```
40 psi = 30g
60 psi = 60g
80 psi = 90g
95 psi  = 101 - 105g
100 psi = 100 - 113g 
130 psi = 130 - 136g
```
