For this test we need to be able to install the bootloader on the atmega328p-au ans prgram it. The new PCB has the pins to be able to program it.

### Instructions website:
https://electronoobs.io/tutorial/187

### Ardunio instruction to add bootloader:
Use section 2.1 of url to setup arduino IDE to function as bootloader. We should probably do this once and then when we got it working once just bootloader all the boards. 

### To add a program to the chip:
Use section 3.1 to program a new ardunio program. Device addresses will be related to the solinoid couples number.

### Wiring diagrams:
Boarding to arduino wiring.
